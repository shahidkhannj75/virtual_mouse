The Virtual Mouse project is an innovative application that allows users to control their computer cursor using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques and hand tracking, this project provides a seamless and intuitive way to interact with your computer without the need for a physical mouse.
Features
Index Finger Control: Move the cursor by raising and moving your index finger.
No Accidental Movements: Cursor movement is only activated when the hand is in the desired state.
